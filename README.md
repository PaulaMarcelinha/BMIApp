BMI Calculator Application

I've created a BMI Calculator that allows a user to check their BMI results and lets them know the range they fall into.
Users have a choice of inputting their height in either Centimetres or Feet & Inches and their weight in either Kilograms or Stone & Pounds. 

The application defaults to Centimetres and Kilograms, however using radio buttons they can change it and it will also change the input boxes.
